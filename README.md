# Web-Scraping-Challenge "MIssion to Mars"

**A project designed to show the latest data about Mars on a web page through the use of web scraping, MongoDB, BootStrap, BeautifulSoup and Flask**

**Web Scraping** is simply extracting data from websites.  In my research and learning about web scraping and how to use it, it was intersting to note that the legality of web scraping varies across the world. In general, web scraping may be against the terms of use of some websites.  However, even a simple 'copy/paste' from a website can be considered web scraping.  A good rule of thumb (in the United States) is if your data isn't being used for the following, it is allowable: 
1. Copyright Infringement (compilation)
2. Violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act ("CFAA")
3. Trespass to Chattel (Legal jargon for infringing party intentionally interfered with another person's lawful possession of movable personal property (read: website)

**MongoDB** is a cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, it uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. 

**Flask** is a micro web framework written in Python. This means flask provides you with tools, libraries and technologies that allow you to build a web application. This web application can be some web pages, a blog, a wiki or go as big as a web-based calendar application or a commercial website.  It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools. Extensions are updated more frequently than the core Flask program. (Wiki helped me describe Flask!)

**BootStrap** is a free and open-source CSS framework that is meant to help you design websites faster and easier. It includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels, etc. It also gives you support for JavaScript plugins.

**BeautifulSoup** is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It creates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be used to extract data from HTML, which is useful for web scraping.  (Parse is the process of analyzing a string of symbols, either in natural language, computer languages or data structures, conforming to the rules of a formal grammar)

Data, images and tables were pulled from NASA Mars News, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Mars Weather Twitter Account, and USGS Astrogeology
